        <h3>People we are looking for</h3>
        <p>
          If you feel underchallenged and eager to explore your limits, mesh. is
          where you want to be. We are looking for people who either have their
          own project in mind or want to try out something new. For the latter,
          we have plenty of ideas for you to start with. If you just want a
          great community to be a part of, you can also help developing it. The
          community itself is welcoming and open to any questions, you don’t
          have to be a people person, but we require that you respect the values
          we stand for.
        </p>
        <h3>What we can give you</h3>
        <p>
          We have an office and a workshop you can work in, meet and talk to
          other interesting people. If needed, we can also provide tools,
          material and academic help with anything. Due to our extensive network
          of mentors and seniors, we will be able to find a solution to all your
          needs. We also have a great community, in which we have dinners, beer,
          meaningful conversations, etc…. If you lack motivation to follow
          through with something, here we work by motivating each other.
        </p>
        <h3>What we require from a member</h3>
        <p>
          A member of mesh. can be active or passive. An active member is either
          working on a project on a weekly basis, or helping organizing events,
          building the community (or both). We also require that you respect the
          values and rules of the organizations. An inactive member can choose
          between being totally inactive, or “passive”. When someone is passive,
          other members can still ask him/her to help with an event, question or
          project.
        </p>
        <h3>What we can give and require from a senior</h3>
        <p>
          We organize events for them so that they can get to know each other.
          We also provide a platform, on which they find the best, most
          ambitious youngsters. Seniors can participate in nurturing the future
          generation of engineers. A senior is someone who contributes to and
          helps the community. This can be done either materially or providing
          knowledge with their expertise.
